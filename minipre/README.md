# minipre
My cool new project!

GOAL: create mini pre-processor

read a file and ignore lines
accept lines between ```fortran and ```
and then obey
#define EXPR
#if EXPR #else #elseif EXPR #endif
where EXPR is an expression using M_calculator

Add parcels and looping

Allow changing '#' to some other prefix, maybe with leading whitespace and multiple characters

Versus one using M_matrix 

Templating options and in-block expansion
