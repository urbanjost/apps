NAME
  txt2man - [DEVELOPER] convert flat ASCII text to manpage format
SYNOPSIS
  txt2man [-hpTxX] [-t mytitle] [-P pname] [-r rel] [-s sect]
          [-v vol] [-I txt] [-B txt] [ifile]
DESCRIPTION
  txt2man converts the input text into nroff/troff standard man(7)
  macros used to format Unix manual pages. Nice pages can be generated;
  particularly for commands (section 1 or 8) or for C functions (sections
  2, 3), with the ability to recognize and format command and function
  names, flags, types and arguments.

  txt2man is also able to recognize and format sections, paragraphs,
  lists (standard, numbered, description, nested), cross references and
  literal display blocks.

  If an input file ifile is omitted, standard input is used. The result
  is displayed on standard output.

  Here is how text patterns are recognized and processed:
  Sections    These headers are defined by a line in upper case, starting
              in column 1. If there is one or more leading spaces, a
	      sub-section will be generated instead.
	      NOTE that a section resets the indent; so an uppercase
	      line is ALWAYS the beginning of a section and will reset
	      being in fixed space mode.
  Paragraphs  They must be separated by a blank line, and consistently left 
              aligned (all lines must have the same left margin).
  Tag list    The item definition is separated from the item description
              by at least 2 blank spaces, even before a new line, if
              the definition is too long. Definition will be emphasized
              by default.
  Bullet list  
              Bullet list items are defined by the first word being "-"
	      or "*" or "o" or "+".
  Enumerated list  
	      The first word must be a number followed by a dot.
  Literal display blocks  
	      This paragraph type is used to display unmodified text,
	      for example source code. It must be separated by a blank
	      line, and be indented. 
	      It will be printed using a fixed font whenever possible 
	      (troff).

	      So that means you put a blank line above a code block and
	      that there has to have been at least one previous line in
	      the section to set the default indent and that the code 
	      must be indented relative to that line:

	      SECTION BEGINNING
	         Line to set the default paragraph indent
		   
		    code starts indented with a blank line

  Cross references  
	      A cross reference (another manpage) is defined by a word
	      followed by a number in parenthesis.

  Special sections:
  NAME      The function or command name and short description are set in
            this section.
  SYNOPSIS  This section receives a special treatment to identify command
            name, flags and arguments, and propagate corresponding
            attributes later in the text. If a C-like function is recognized
	    (word immediately followed by an open parenthesis), txt2man will
	    print function name in bold font, types in normal font, and
	    variables in italic font. The whole section will be printed using
	    a fixed font family (courier) whenever possible (troff).

  It is a good practice to embed documentation into source code, by using
  comments or constant text variables. txt2man allows one to do that, keeping
  the document source readable, usable even without further formatting
  (i.e. for online help) and easy to write. The result is high quality
  and standard-complying documentation.
OPTIONS
  -h          The option -h displays help.
  -P pname    Set pname as project name in header. Default to uname -s.
  -p          Probe title, section name and volume.
  -t mytitle  Set mytitle as title of generated manpage.
  -r rel      Set rel as project name and release.
  -s sect     Set sect as section in heading, usually a value from 1 to 8.
  -v vol      Set vol as volume name, i.e. "Unix user 's manual".
  -I txt      Italicize text in output. Can be specified more than once.
  -B txt      Emphasize (bold) text in output. Can be specified more than once.
  -T          Text result previewing using PAGER, usually more(1).
  -X          X11 result previewing using gxditview(1).
  -x          Basic example input file
ENVIRONMENT
  PAGER    name of paging command, usually more(1), or less(1). If not set
           falls back to more(1).
EXAMPLE
  Try this command to format this text itself:

      $ txt2man -h 2>&1 | txt2man -T
HINTS
  To obtain an overall good formatting of the output document, keep paragraphs
  indented correctly. If you have unwanted bold sections, search for
  multiple spaces between words, which are used to identify a tag list
  (term followed by a description). Also choose carefully the name of
  command line or function parameters, as they will be emphasized each
  time they are encountered in the document.

BUGS
  - Automatic probe (-p option) works only if input is a regular file (i.e.
  not stdin).

  - Something wrong when use ellipsis ("...")
  - SYNOPSIS

      command [value(s)]
    causes problems with (). 
  - SYNOPSIS
      name ( a, b, c, d )
    causes problems with (). 
    Remove spaces and it is OK.
