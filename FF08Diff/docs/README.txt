This zip file contains source for a ff08-lib derived utility.

The source should be compilable by a Fortran 2003 compiler.

Intel Fortran 15.0 was the compiler used for development.  With that compiler 
the /standard-semantics switch (or its equivalent on non-Windows platforms) 
is required.

The file compile-order.txt specifies the order in which the included source 
files may be compiled.

See comments above the main program (generally in a file with the same base 
name as that of the source file archive) for more information on how to use 
the compiled program.  Once compiled similar help can be obtained by running 
the program and supplying the `--help` command line option.
